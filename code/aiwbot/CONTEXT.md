# aiwbot
> Provider-agnostic bot: control swappable coding agents (claude·opencode·copilot) from chat.
> goal: [workspace-os](../../brain/goals/workspace-os.md)
> spec: none

## Overview
One `AgentBackend` interface normalizes every coding-agent CLI into a stream of `AgentEvent`s,
so the frontend (Telegram) never knows which provider runs underneath — provider is data, not code.
Phase A (current) proves the seam against claude + opencode with a bare harness + free fixture tests,
before any Telegram wiring.

`make test` runs the free fixture tests; `make smoke` runs one live prompt through each backend
(~$0.20). Installing and operating the systemd service is one step of
[`SETUP-accounts.md`](../../SETUP-accounts.md) § Telegram bot, where every other account-bound
feature's install already lives.

| Subdirectory | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [`backend/`](backend/CONTEXT.md) | Provider-agnostic seam: each coding-agent CLI → normalized AgentEvent stream; one class per provider. |
| [`frontend/`](frontend/CONTEXT.md) | Telegram frontend on the AgentBackend seam — /new + reply-to-continue + INBOX capture. |
| [`tests/`](tests/CONTEXT.md) | Free unit tests — pure-logic fixtures/parsers/formatting, no network or cost. |
