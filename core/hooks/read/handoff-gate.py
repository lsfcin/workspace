# PreToolUse: Read + Write + Bash — a handoff is opened by taking it. Every other way in is refused with the one command that does it.
#
# Taking prints every pending section and deletes the file under the lock writers share
# (core/tools/wos/close/handoff.py), so the session that opens a handoff owns its threads and no
# parallel session can append into a file already handed out. A plain read would leave it pending
# for the next session too, and a direct write would skip the append that keeps another session's
# section. The shell arm fires only on a handoff file that EXISTS, named in a command that is not the
# tool: `ls outputs/handoff-*` names no file and passes. Residual: a path built at run time escapes.
