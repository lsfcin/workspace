> Coverage for `core/hooks/git/`: branch shape, push diagnosis, and the mirror a pull leaves stale.

What these share is that the operator learns the result here or not at all — a push that failed and
a branch that moved under a running session are both silent in git's own output, so what the hook
names as the cause is the whole of what anyone knows.

**Named `vcs/` and not `git/`, which would match the hook directory.** pytest puts the parent
`gates/` on `sys.path` for the test files that stay there, and a bare `git/` directory under it is
an importable namespace package (PEP 420) — so `import git` inside this repo would reach these
tests instead of GitPython the day anything depends on it. A shadowing trap that fires years later
is worth one word of convention.

| [`test_auto_push.py`](test_auto_push.py) | [`test_auto_push.pyi`](test_auto_push.pyi) | — | T0 the auto-push hook's diagnosis. core/hooks/post-commit is the only place most sessions ever learn that pushing failed, so what it names as the cause is the whole of what the operator knows. |

| [`test_branch_debt.py`](test_branch_debt.py) | [`test_branch_debt.pyi`](test_branch_debt.pyi) | `git`, `commit`, `repo`, `cloned` | T0 the branch-debt signals: a repo is a finding when work lives in only one place, and never otherwise. Zero-token, runs in verify-fast. |
| [`test_branch_marker.py`](test_branch_marker.py) | [`test_branch_marker.pyi`](test_branch_marker.pyi) | `marker_path`, `repo`, `run` | T0 the branch-drift warning (core/hooks/SPECS.md § Branch drift): HEAD moving under a session must be said out loud, exactly once, and must never block. |
