# b20260922 regression — a session outlives a reboot, and its marker store has to outlive one too.
#
# WHAT HAPPENED. A session opened 2026-09-21 was resumed after the machine booted at 00:11 on
# 2026-09-22. Its seen-markers lived in the temp directory, which the boot emptied, so the context
# gate re-demanded three CONTEXT.md files the session still had whole in its window. Nothing was
# broken afterwards and nothing logged it: the only trace was tokens spent re-reading. A gate that
# asks "did this session read it" and is answered by a directory the operating system wiped cannot
# tell a forgotten read from one that never happened.
#
# WHY THE ASSERTION IS ABOUT PLACE AND NOT ABOUT REBOOTS. A test cannot reboot the machine. What it
# can pin is the property that made the reboot matter: session state is asked of one function, and
# that function answers with a directory the workspace owns rather than one the system may empty.
