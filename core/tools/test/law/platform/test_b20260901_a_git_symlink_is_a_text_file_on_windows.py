# b20260901 regression — no tracked file in this workspace is a git symlink.
#
# brain/memory/user_profile.md was stored as mode 120000 pointing at ../USER.md. Windows git runs
# with core.symlinks=false, so that clone materialised a 10-byte text file whose whole content was
# the string `../USER.md` — and brain/memory/MEMORY.md routed every reader straight to it, handing
# them that string instead of Lucas's profile.
#
# The ruling this restores is SETUP-clone.md § Skill mirrors (2026-08-29): native symlinks under Git
# Bash need Developer Mode, a privilege out of proportion to this workspace. The skill mirrors became
# copies then; this one file never followed. The class check is the point — a symlink is invisible on
# the machine that creates it and only misreads on the other one, so nothing local ever reports it.
