# Handoff skill

Produce the resume prompt for the next session. Capture only what is **not already in project files** — reference the file instead of repeating it.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS  (focus for next session)

## Decide first — is there anything to hand off?

**If the work is finished and there is no next action, do not emit a resume prompt.** Writing one *manufactures* a next action at the last turn before a `/clear` — the output rule ([`roundup.md`](roundup.md) § The output rule) applied to the hand-off itself. That is not a rare edge case; it is how a session that closed properly ends.

Skipping is one command and one line:

```bash
core/run tools/wos/handoff --clear
```

Then say: *nothing open — no hand-off written.* Nothing else, and stop here.

Clear only if this session still owns the pair's latest handoff; preserve a newer replacement. **The file's existence means exactly one thing: its thread is open.** Leaving the previous session's block in place would let the next window resume a thread that closed sessions ago, and a stub saying "nothing open" costs a read to learn there is nothing to read.

Hand off when work is mid-flight, a decision is pending, or a trial remains unresolved. If unsure, write it: a dropped thread costs the next session its reconstruction.

## Gather state

**If [`core/tools/wos/roundup`](../tools/wos/roundup) ran this session, every line it printed *is*
the State block — copy them verbatim and gather nothing.** They are the same facts, already paid for. Re-deriving them costs a second round of git at the session's most expensive turn, and lets the two disagree. Which lines it prints is the script's business, never this file's: naming them here is a copy that goes stale without failing anything.

Only when it did not run (`/handoff` invoked mid-session, standalone):

```bash
git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null
git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null
git status --short 2>/dev/null | wc -l
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)' refs/heads 2>/dev/null
git log --oneline main..develop 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

Cite a verification result only if one is fresh from this session; otherwise say "not run".

**Report sync divergence, never fix it.** `/handoff` can be invoked mid-session, so merging here risks promoting unverified work. Just state what is unpushed or unpromoted (`[ahead N]` on any branch, or `develop` ahead of `main`) so a session resumed on another machine knows what it is missing.
Promotion is `/roundup` Phase 4 — point there if anything is behind.

## Output

Prepare the block in a temporary file, then publish it with `core/run tools/wos/handoff --write <file> --json`. Print the returned path and the block. The common tool owns naming: `outputs/handoff-<repository>-<environment>.md`; environment means ChatGPT or Claude, never a workflow role. One file per repository/environment: the latest publication replaces the previous one. Session metadata protects a newer handoff from being cleared by an older session; it adds no filename suffix.

The repository with the most confirmed session Edit/patch additions + removals wins, with a deterministic tie break. The report states the measurement's limits: shell/script writes, full-file replacements and implicit deletions are not measurable. Without measurable edits, use the working repository and report that fallback. Never count the shared dirty tree as this session's work. Native session variables identify the session automatically; when unavailable, pass `--session` and `--agent` from native metadata. Never guess from the newest transcript, or add a session suffix to the filename. This is local code: no model call and no automatic context loading.

**Never spawn a successor session.** Decided 2026-08-13 ([`core/SPECS.md`](../SPECS.md) § AD-09):
`claude --bg` can start a fresh-context agent but cannot move the terminal Lucas types into, so a spawned successor would work the same branch *unattended, in parallel with the live session*. Prepare the artifact; let Lucas move his own attention.

**Every section earns its place or is omitted.** Delete empty headers; no placeholders. The caps below keep the next session from rereading project lists.

**Name what you decided alone.** git holds what changed and never the option that was rejected, so a choice a session made for Lucas without asking is invisible the moment it lands — and the longer it holds, the more expensive it is to reopen. List them; the point is that he can object cheaply, while the alternative is still live. The durable record is [`roundup.md`](roundup.md) Phase 2's job (a design decision goes to `SPECS.md` → Architecture Decisions, Context / Decision / Consequences);
this section only makes sure he *sees* the ones nobody asked him about.

**Say it once.** If a fact is already in a list — a `ROADMAP.md` item, a `ISSUES.md` entry, a `SPECS.md` decision — point at the file; do not restate it. The next session reads those anyway, and a hand-off that duplicates them is a second copy to keep in sync.

Print the block between the `---` markers:

---

```
## Resume — [PROJECT] — [DATE]

### Next action
[If $ARGUMENTS: use as directive. Else: the single next step, from ROADMAP + current state.]

### Worked on
[≤3 bullets, and only what no list already holds. Shipped work is in git and the ROADMAP —
 what belongs here is what a reader of those files would still not know.]

### Open threads
[Discussed but unresolved — dead ends and what was tried. Omit the whole section if there are none.]

### Decided without asking
[One line each: the choice, and the option not taken. Only choices Lucas could reasonably have made
 differently — not every judgement call. Point at the SPECS.md AD if one was written. Omit if none.]

### State
[Every line core/tools/wos/roundup printed this session, verbatim, in its order.
 If it did not run this session, one line: "roundup not run".]
[≤2 files worth opening first, one line each, only if not obvious from ROADMAP.]
```

After printing:

> Resume prompt ready — written to `<returned path>`. Open a new session and start it with: `Lê <returned path> e discute comigo em detalhes (em pt-br) qual vai ser o plano pra essa sessão.` **Plan, never "continue"** (Lucas, 2026-08-16): planning reads the whole list and surfaces blocked decisions before work resumes.
